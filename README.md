# üåç Global Internship Marketplace ‚Äì System Design Report

## üî∞ Project Goal
Design a globally distributed system that connects **international students** with **internship opportunities** worldwide. The system should automate application processes, document verification, and legal compliance across borders.

Category | Non-Functional Requirement | Reason / Justification
üéØ Accuracy | High data accuracy & integrity | Legal documents, visa forms, contracts must be 100% accurate ‚Äî errors can block applications or cause legal issues.
‚öñÔ∏è Compliance | Data residency & regulation compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) | Mandatory to operate internationally ‚Äî student data must stay within specific regions.
‚öôÔ∏è Consistency | Strong consistency for critical workflows (e.g., document submission, status tracking) | Students must see the true status of their applications at all times. Documents must not go out of sync.
üöÄ Scalability | Scalable to global user base (millions of students/employers) | Especially during peak cycles like summer internships or job fairs.
üí° Availability | High availability (ideally 99.9%+) | Employers and students may come from different time zones. Downtime directly impacts trust and usage.
üîê Security & Privacy | End-to-end encryption, role-based access, consent management | Users upload highly sensitive documents (IDs, visas, contracts). Any leak = reputation + legal disaster.
üì¶ Auditability | Complete audit logs for legal actions (submission, editing, consent) | Required by law for disputes, inspections, or internal compliance.
üß† Adaptability | Support for country-specific rule changes | Laws and visa requirements change frequently. System must evolve without downtime.
üåç Localization | Multilingual, culturally adaptive UI | Targeting a global audience ‚Äî students from over 100 countries.
‚è± Latency | Low-latency access to localized services | Delays in form submission or status changes hurt user experience. Especially critical in real-time interview scheduling or uploads.
üîÑ Resilience | Fault tolerance & graceful degradation | One region going down should not take down the global system. Retry mechanisms and failovers must be in place.
üì£ Observability | Monitoring, alerting, and tracing | Needed for compliance, quick issue resolution, and user trust.

## üß† Problem Analysis

### Key Challenges
- Legal complexity across jurisdictions (visa, labor laws, document formats)
- Global availability and scalability
- Accuracy in sensitive data and compliance
- Routing applications through the correct verification/legal channels
- Secure authentication and document storage

## üß± System Components

### Software Services (Modular Monolith + Externalized Engines)
- **User Service**: Registration, authentication (OAuth2), profiles
- **Application Service**: Submitting & tracking internship applications
- **Matching Engine**: Filters and ranks internship offers based on skills, location, language
- **Document Service**: File uploads, format checks, OCR, checksum validation
- **Verification Service**: Interfaces with embassies, universities, and background checks
- **Legal Compliance Engine**: Evaluates legal fit, flags violations per jurisdiction
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Saga pattern coordinator for multistep operations
- **Notification Service**: Sends SMS, emails, system alerts
- **Admin & Analytics Dashboard**: For staff, support, and monitoring
- **Audit Logger**: Stores immutable logs for legal reviews
